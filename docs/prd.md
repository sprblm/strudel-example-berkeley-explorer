## 1. Executive Summary

The Berkeley Environmental Health Explorer (BEHE) is an educational web application built using STRUDEL Kit. It serves as a learning tool to promote citizen science. It supports students in Berkeley to collect, analyze, and understand the relationship between tree canopy and air quality in Berkeley, and more specifically contribute data about the aforementioned  immediately around the University of California, Berkeley campus. The platform leverages STRUDEL task flows to create a hands-on, user-centered experience for working with hyper-local environmental data.

## 2. Product Vision

### 2.1 Vision Statement

To create an engaging, educational platform where Berkeley students can actively learn about and contribute to the understanding of the micro-environmental interplay between tree canopy and air quality on and around campus, utilizing robust data practices and user-centered design principles facilitated by the STRUDEL Kit.

### 2.2 Target Users

- **Berkeley Students**: Primarily high schools students from Berkeley in AP Biology, as well as, undergraduates and graduates in environmental science, data science, geography, urban planning, and related fields using the tool for coursework.
- **Berkeley Instructors/Educators**: Utilizing the platform for teaching environmental monitoring, data visualization, and citizen science principles.
- **Campus Facilities/Sustainability Office**: Potential users for accessing student-collected data to supplement campus management efforts.
- **Interested Local Community Members**: Exploring environmental conditions on campus.

### 2.3 User Needs Addressed

- Easy access to existing tree inventory and air quality data specific to the city of Berkeley.
- Intuitive, mobile-friendly tools for contributing new tree measurements and air quality observations during class exercises or fieldwork.
- Simple visualization tools to explore patterns and relationships between trees and air quality in familiar campus locations.
- A practical platform for learning data collection, validation, and analysis techniques in an urban environmental context.

- As a campus user, I want to quickly check the recorded health status of a specific landmark tree.

#### 3.1.3 Requirements

1. Map-based search interface centered on the UC Berkeley.
2. Filtering options:
   - Tree characteristics (species, recorded health, DBH range) available in the [dataset](https://geodata.lib.berkeley.edu/catalog/berkeley-s7gq2s).
   - Air quality parameters from nearby sensors/stations (using AirNow API) or student contributions.
   - Campus locations (building names, quads, landmarks).
   - Time periods relevant to coursework or campus events.
3. Search results display:
   - List or map pins showing individual trees or data points.
   - Basic metadata preview (species, date, measurement value).
   - Link to explore data in more detail.

### 3.2 Explore Data

#### 3.2.1 Description

Enables users to visualize and understand patterns in campus tree data and local air quality.

#### 3.2.2 User Stories

- As a student, I want to see if the density of trees in the Faculty Glade correlates with lower PM2.5 readings compared to Bancroft Way.
- As an instructor, I want to show students the distribution of different tree species across campus on an interactive map.
- As a user, I want to explore how air quality readings near campus change throughout the day based on available data.

#### 3.2.3 Requirements

- Interactive map visualization:
  - Campus map showing tree locations, colored/sized by attributes (species, health, DBH).
  - Overlay of nearby air quality data points or interpolated zones (if feasible).
  - Ability to click on features for more information.
- Simple charting:
  - Time series plots for available air quality data points.
  - Basic bar charts showing species distribution or health ratings.
- Filtering controls directly linked to the map/charts (species, health, time).
- Basic data summary statistics for selected areas or datasets.

### 3.3 Compare Data

#### 3.3.1 Description

Enables users to directly compare environmental conditions between different campus areas or time periods.

#### 3.3.2 User Stories

- As a student, I want to compare the average reported health of trees in the sunny Memorial Glade versus the shadier Eucalyptus Grove.
- As an instructor, I want students to compare air quality readings before and after a major campus construction project started near a monitoring point.
- As a user, I want to see how the number of contributed tree observations differs between the north and south sides of campus.

#### 3.3.3 Requirements

- Side-by-side comparison interface:
  - Ability to select two distinct campus zones (via map selection) or two time ranges.
  - Synchronized map views (if comparing zones).
  - Comparative charts (e.g., bar charts of species mix, time series overlays).
  - Simple statistical difference summaries (e.g., average DBH, difference in mean PM2.5).

### 3.4 Contribute Data

#### 3.4.1 Description

Enables students to easily add field observations (tree data, air quality spots) via a web interface, particularly optimized for mobile use during fieldwork.

#### 3.4.2 User Stories

- As a student in the field, I want to quickly add a new tree I measured, including its location, species guess, DBH, and a photo, using my phone.
- As a student with a portable air sensor, I want to upload my collected reading (value, time, location) for a class assignment.
- As an instructor, I want to review student contributions for accuracy and provide feedback.

#### 3.4.3 Requirements

- Data contribution forms (Mobile-first design):
  - Tree inventory form: Map-based location picker (GPS helpful), species selection (dropdown/autocomplete, potentially with image helper link), DBH input (with instructions/diagram), height/spread estimate, health rating (simple scale), photo upload.
  - Air quality spot measurement form: Location picker, timestamp (auto/manual), parameter selection (PM2.5, CO2, etc.), value input, sensor type (optional).
- Basic Validation:
  - Location must be within campus boundaries or immediate vicinity.
  - Required fields must be filled.
  - Numeric ranges for measurements (sanity checks).
- User identification (link contribution to student user, if logged in).
- (Optional Phase 2) Simple review queue/flagging system for instructors.
