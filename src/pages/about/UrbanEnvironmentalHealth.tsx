      <List sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
        <ListItem>
          1. Air Quality: Urban areas often suffer from poor air quality due to
          pollution from vehicles, industrial activities, and other sources.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          2. Green Infrastructure: Urban trees and green spaces play a crucial
          role in improving air quality, mitigating the urban heat island
          effect, and providing recreational areas for residents.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          3. Water Management: Urban water management is critical to prevent
          flooding and ensure clean water for residents.

      </List>
      <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ mb: 1 }}>
        Importance of Urban Trees
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
        Urban trees are vital for improving air quality by absorbing pollutants
        and producing oxygen. They also help in reducing the urban heat island
        effect by providing shade and cooling the air through
        evapotranspiration.

      <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ mb: 1 }}>
        Air Quality Measurements
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
        Monitoring air quality is essential to understand the levels of
        pollutants in urban areas. This data can be used to implement policies
        to reduce pollution and improve public health.
